# Weather App  

## Project Overview  
The Weather App is a Flask-based web application that provides real-time weather information for cities worldwide. Using the OpenWeather API, the app displays current temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more.  

## Key Features  
- **Real-Time Weather Forecast:** Fetches accurate weather data for any city using the OpenWeather API.  
- **Global Accessibility:** Search for weather updates for cities across the world.  
- **Responsive Design:** A clean and user-friendly interface built with HTML5 and CSS3.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **API Integration:** OpenWeather API  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3  

## How to Use  
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Set Up API Key:**  
   - Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
   - Replace `<your_api_key>` in the application code with your actual API key.  

4. **Run the Application:**  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

5. **Access the App:**  
   Open your web browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000  
   ```  
   Enter a city name to view its weather details.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement geolocation to auto-detect the user's location and show the weather.  
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and interactive charts.  
- Display additional weather metrics like wind speed and sunrise/sunset times.
